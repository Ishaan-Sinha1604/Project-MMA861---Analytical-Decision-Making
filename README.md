# Project-MMA861---Analytical-Decision-Making
Selecting soccer players for the Fantasy Premier League team based on past season performance, using the Optimization model.

Gathered data from the Premier League official website.
Used an Integer Programming Optimization Model on Excel using the Evolver tool. (Could not use Solver tool as the optimization model was too large to run on it)
